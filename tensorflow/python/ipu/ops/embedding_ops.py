  """Looks up `ids` in a list of embedding tensors.

    This is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the typical use cases with
    `tf.nn.embedding_lookup` for the IPU.

    Args:
        params: A single tensor representing the complete embedding tensor.
        ids: A `Tensor` with type `int32` containing the slices to be extracted
             from `params`.
        name: A name for the operation.
        one_hot_threshold: The threshold below which the embedding lookup will
                           become a one-hot with matmul.
        min_encoding_size: The minimum encoding size for the embedding. This is
                           used to decide whether to split the embedding tensor.
    Returns:
        A `Tensor` with the same type as the tensors in `params`.
