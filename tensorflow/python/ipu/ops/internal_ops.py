def print_tensor(input, name=None):
  """Print the specified input.

  Args:
    input: The tensor to print.
    name: Optional op name.

  Returns:
    An operator that prints the specified input to the standard error. For the
    tensor to be printed one must either return it as part of their XLA function
    which is consumed by ipu_compiler.compile, or include the returned op in the
    input to session.run, or use the operator as a control dependency for
    executed ops by specifying with tf.control_dependencies([print_op]).

  Examples:
    1. Returning the print operation as part of the XLA function:

    .. code-block:: python

       import tensorflow as tf

       from tensorflow.python.ipu.ops import internal_ops
       from tensorflow.python.ipu import scopes

       def my_net(v):
         print_op = internal_ops.print_tensor(v)
         v = v + 1
         return v, print_op

       with scope.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
         res = ipu_compiler.compile(my_net, inputs=[v])

       ...
       ...

     2. Including the print operation in session.run:

     .. code-block:: python

       import numpy as np
       import tensorflow as tf

       from tensorflow.python.ipu.ops import internal_ops
       from tensorflow.python.ipu import scopes

       with ops.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
         pa = tf.placeholder(np.float32, [2, 2], name="a")
         print_op = internal.print_tensor(pa)
         x = pa + 1

       with tf.Session() as session:
        result = session.run([x, print_op], feed_dict={pa : np.ones([2, 2])})

       ...
       ...

     3. Using control dependencies:

     .. code-block:: python

       import numpy as np
       import tensorflow as tf

       from tensorflow.python.ipu.ops import internal_ops
       from tensorflow.python.ipu import scopes

       with ops.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
         pa = tf.placeholder(np.float32, [2, 2], name="a")
         print_op = internal.print_tensor(pa)
         with tf.control_dependencies([print_op]):
           x = pa + 1

       with tf.Session() as session:
        result = session.run(x, feed_dict={pa : np.ones([2, 2])})

       ...
       ...

  """

  return gen_poputil_ops.ipu_print_tensor(input, name=name)
