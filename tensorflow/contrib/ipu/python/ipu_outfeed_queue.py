    operation generated by this function will block if called prior
    to any enqueues.

    The return value of this operation depends on the enqueued tensors,
    replication factor and the execution mode.

    1. Outfeed returning a single tensor:

    .. code-block:: python

        outfeed_queue = ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue(replication_factor=2)

        def body(input):
          output = input + 1
          outfeed = outfeed_queue.enqueue(output)
          return (output, outfeed)

        def my_net(input):
          r = loops.repeat(20, body, (input))
          return r

        with ipu.ops.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
          res = ipu_compiler.compile(my_net, inputs=[v])

        with ops.device('cpu'):
          v = tf.placeholder(np.float32, [4, 4])

        outfeed = outfeed_queue.dequeue()
        with tf.Session() as sess:
          result = sess.run(res, {v:np.ones([4, 4], np.float32)})
          outfed = sess.run(outfeed)

    In this example the tensor `output` is of shape [4, 4] and it's enqueued
    into the outfeed with replication_factor = 2. If the Outfeed mode is
    outfeed_all == True, then the shape of the resulting `outfed` tensor will
    be [20, 2, 4, 4], where the first dimension represents the number of times
    we have enqueued a tensor to the outfeed - in this example the loop is
    repeated 20 times, and therefore we get 20 values back from the outfeed.
    The second dimension is the replication_factor, which allows us to see the
    individual values from each replicated graph. If the Outfeed mode is
    outfeed_all == False, then the shape of the resulting `outfed` tensor will
    be [2, 4, 4], which represents the value of the output tensor the last
    time it was enqueued during execution for each of the replicated graphs.

    2. Outfeed returning a tuple of tensors:

    .. code-block:: python

        outfeed_queue = ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue()

        def body(input):
          output = input + 1
          sum = tf.reduce_sum(output)
          outfeed = outfeed_queue.enqueue((output, sum))
          return (output, outfeed)

        def my_net(input):
          r = loops.repeat(20, body, (input))
          return r

        with ipu.ops.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
          res = ipu_compiler.compile(my_net, inputs=[v])

        with ops.device('cpu'):
          v = tf.placeholder(np.float32, [4, 4])

        outfeed = outfeed_queue.dequeue()
        with tf.Session() as sess:
          result = sess.run(res, {v:np.ones([4, 4], np.float32)})
          outfed = sess.run(outfeed)

    In this example we outfeed a tuple of tensors, `output` and `sum`, where
    the former is of shape [4, 4] and latter [1]. If the Outfeed mode is
    outfeed_all == True, then the resulting outfed is a two-tuple of tensors
    with shapes ([20, 4, 4], [20, 1]), where the first dimension in each of
    the tensors represents the number of times we have enqueued these tensors
    to the outfeed - in this example the loop is repeated 20 times, and
    therefore we get 20 values back from the outfeed for each of the tensors
    in the tuple. If the Outfeed mode is outfeed_all == False, then the
    `outfed` is a two tuple of tensors with shapes ([4, 4], [1]), which
    represents the values of the `output` and `sum` tensors the last time
    they were enqueued during execution.
    Note that `replication_factor` here is the default (=1), which means that
    the extra replication dimension is not added.

    3. Outfeed returning a dictionary of tensors:

    .. code-block:: python

        outfeed_queue = ipu_outfeed_queue.IPUOutfeedQueue(replication_factor=8)

        def body(input):
          output = input + 1
          sum = tf.reduce_sum(output)
          outfeed = outfeed_queue.enqueue({"x": output,
                                           "y": sum})
          return (output, outfeed)

        def my_net(input):
          r = loops.repeat(40, body, (input))
          return r

        with ipu.ops.ipu_scope("/device:IPU:0"):
          res = ipu_compiler.compile(my_net, inputs=[v])

        with ops.device('cpu'):
          v = tf.placeholder(np.float32, [4, 4])

        outfeed = outfeed_queue.dequeue()
        with tf.Session() as sess:
          result = sess.run(res, {v:np.ones([4, 4], np.float32)})
          outfed = sess.run(outfeed)

    In this example we outfeed a dictionary of tensors, `output` and `sum`,
    where the former is of shape [4, 4] and latter [1]. If the Outfeed mode is
    outfeed_all == True, then the resulting outfed is a dictionary of tensors
    with shapes: {"x": [40, 8, 4, 4], "y": [40, 8, 1]}, where the first
    dimension in each of the tensors represents the number of times we have
    enqueued these tensors to the outfeed - in this example the loop is
    repeated 40 times, and therefore we get 40 values back from the outfeed
    for each of the tensors in the tuple. The second dimension is the
    replication_factor, which allows us to see the individual values from each
    replicated graph. If the Outfeed mode is outfeed_all == False, then the
    `outfed` is a dictionary of tensors with shapes:
    {"x": [8, 4, 4], "y": [8, 1]}, which represents the values of
    the `output` and `sum` tensors the last time they were enqueued during
    execution for each of the replicated graphs.
